            <img src="Images/bg.jpeg" alt="image02">
            <p>Welcome to Enchanted FLorals, where every bloom tells a story. Our journey began over a decade ago with a simple passion for flowers and a dream to bring nature’s beauty into people's lives.
                Enchanted Florals was founded in 2020 by Clara Gray, who grew up surrounded by the vibrant colors and fragrances of their grandmother's garden. From an early age, Clara was captivated by the joy and serenity that flowers could bring. This passion blossomed into a desire to share that beauty with others.</p>
